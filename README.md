### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client who wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. The application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues, where the players are supposed to guess the puzzle based on the completed 
### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt that I did a good job with the UML diagram. As for later portions, they really tested my knowledge and required me to go out of my way to find information. There were times, especially in regards to networking, where I felt completely out of my depth. 
### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The software design document really assisted me when putting together the clients needs. Being able to reference the gaming room's desires in this project was helpful when it came to knowing what capabilities the application needed. 
### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I would revise the table. As I currently have insufficient understanding on many of the operating systems, I feel that I was unable to provide satisfactory answers. 
### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
A client's needs are the most important aspect. As long as it is possible for their needs to be implimented, it should be done. Considering their needs, such as which platforms to deploy on, whether to use a distributed system, and whether to use cloud hosting should all be done before trying to begin software design. In this assignment, I tried to understand the client's desires before looking for solutions which could effectively impliment them. 
### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I tried to stay in line with the clients desires as much as possible. This resulted in me doing a lot of reading up on different cloud computing platforms, as they seemed like the best way to meet the client's desires on this project. In the future, I hope that I have a stronger understanding of platforms such as Azure and AWS so that I can more effectively make recommendations.
